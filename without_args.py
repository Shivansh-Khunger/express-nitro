This module provides utilities for interacting with the operating system.

It includes functionality for handling files and directories (os, pathlib, shutil), 
running subprocesses (subprocess), parsing command-line arguments (argparse), 
and downloading content from URLs (urllib.request). It also provides access to 
JSON functionality (json), file and directory permissions (stat), and system-specific 
parameters (platform).
